      "\n",
      "Pybind11 is a lightweight, header-only library that that exposes C++ functions as Python modules, which can be used to interact with compiled C++ code from Python. This powerful library allows us to take advantage of the performance benefits that come with C++ while still using the python ecosystem. It is an ideal tool for quants who want to improve the performance of their python scripts.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this chapter, we will explore Pybind11 in detail. We will discuss how Pybind11 can be integrated into existing C++ projects and show how to create Python bindings for these projects. We will also show how to write generic code with Pybind11 that is compatible with various Python versions and platforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the end of this chapter, you will be familiar with Pybind11 and how to use it to create C++ bindings for Python. We will also illustrate the benefits of using Pybind11 in quant finance using a fictional Sherlock Holmes mystery, in which we will use Pybind11 to solve a case. So let’s begin!\n",
      "The Case of the Missing Market Data\n",
      "\n",
      "Sherlock Holmes was once again on the case, and this time it was a puzzling one. A major financial institution had lost a significant amount of market data and needed it recovered immediately. The institution had backup data, but the system used to restore it required manual intervention, making the process slow and error-prone. Holmes knew that time was of the essence and the data could be critical to solving a more significant case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes knew that he had to solve the case quickly if he wanted to catch the culprit responsible for the data loss. After carefully analyzing the details of the case, he knew that it would be beneficial to leverage Pybind11 to speed up the data recovery process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes quickly assembled a team of experts in C++ and Python to help him generate the Pybind11 bindings necessary to create a Python script to automate the backup data restoration process.\n",
      "\n",
      "With Pybind11, they were able to make use of the existing C++ code that handled the data recovery process, and generate Python bindings to make it easily accessible from Python. The team quickly wrote a Python script that would automate the data recovery process, reducing the time to restore the data by over 90%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The script efficiently analyzed the backup data and restored all the lost data without any manual intervention. This allowed Holmes and his team to solve the case quickly and efficiently, with no further loss of data.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, the culprit behind the data loss was caught and brought to justice, and the financial institution was more than happy with the outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes and his team had proven once again that Pybind11 is a powerful tool for quants, allowing them to easily integrate C++ code with Python to create fast and efficient solutions to even the most complex problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion:\n",
      "\n",
      "In this chapter, we learned about Pybind11, a powerful library that allows us to take advantage of the performance benefits of C++ whilst still using the Python environment. We have seen how Pybind11 can be used to generate Python bindings, which enable us to use existing C++ code from Python. We have also seen how this knowledge can be applied to solve finance-related problems, demonstrating the potential of Pybind11 in the finance industry.\n",
      "In the Sherlock Holmes story, Pybind11 was used to generate Python bindings for an existing C++ program. The Python script was then written using the generated bindings to automate the data recovery process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is an example of how Pybind11 can be used to create Python bindings for a C++ source file:\n",

      "As a Quant, you work with complex data structures that underlie financial models. To harness the power of C++ and make your code more flexible, you use Pybind11 as an interface to Python. In this chapter, we will dive deeper into Pybind11's capabilities, exploring advanced data types and conversion techniques. We will investigate how to work with STL containers and custom classes, and we will learn how to use Pybind11 to convert between Python and C++ types. With these tools, you will be able to write more efficient and flexible Quant code, translating between Python and C++ with ease. So join us on this next step of our journey through the world of Pybind11 for Quants!\n",
      "The Adventure of the Hidden Portfolio\n",

      "Sherlock Holmes had just returned from a trip abroad to find a new case waiting for him. Mr. James, a prominent portfolio manager at a large investment bank, had come to him with a problem. He had recently received extremely promising data from his sources but was unable to analyze it properly. The data was in a custom format, and he needed to convert it to C++ containers to run his algorithms. \n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes immediately began examining the data. It was in a custom format, with elements of different types - Prices, Volumes, and Dates. As he dug deeper into the data, he realized that the Dates were stored as Python datetime objects. Converting such objects to C++ containers would require Advanced Data Types and Conversion using Pybind11, which requires advanced knowledge of type conversions and STL containers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Holmes quickly pulled up his sleeves and began writing code, using Pybind11 to wrap the custom classes in Python, and then converting the Python datetime objects to suitable C++ types. \n",
      "\n",
      "He then used Pybind11 to make a conversion function, which took in a Python list of custom objects and returned a C++ container of tuples, each containing the date, price, and volume data. \n",

      "Certainly! Let's take a look at the key pieces of the code and how they helped Holmes solve the mystery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, Holmes used Pybind11 to create Python objects that wrapped the custom data objects. They are used to provide an interface between Python and C++ so that we can convert the datetime format used in the custom objects to a C++ compatible format.\n",
      "\n",
      "```c++\n",

      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, he implemented a conversion function which takes in a vector of Python objects and converts them to a C++ format that can be used by the portfolio manager:\n",

      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In the function, Pybind11 allows us to use PyDateTime_GET_YEAR, PyDateTime_GET_MONTH and PyDateTime_GET_DAY from Python's datetime library to extract the year, month and day of the date object, respectively. These values are then used to initialize the more C++-friendly Date format of the data.\n",
      "\n",
      "This function is then exposed to Python using the `m.def()` function which binds the function to a module. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, when the function is called from a Python script, Pybind11 automatically handles the conversion between Python objects and C++ vectors of tuples. Holmes was able to leverage Pybind11's Advanced Data Types and Conversion capabilities to solve this financial mystery for the portfolio manager.\n"
